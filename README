Data Studio Project
===================

Interactive tools for big data on Google Cloud Platform. Data Studio enables
developers and data scientists to easily and efficiently explore, transform,
analyze and visualize their data in the cloud.

We're starting with creating a development experience for data analysis using
BigQuery, Python within an IPython-based notebook, and taking that further to
enable the same style of iterative development workflow to developing data
processing pipelines in Java using Cloud Dataflow.
