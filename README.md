# Google Cloud DataLab

Google Cloud DataLab brings interactive tools for big data scenarios on Google
Cloud Platform.

DataLab enables developers and data scientists to easily and efficiently
explore, transform, analyze and visualize their data and develop, test and
deploy data processing pipelines to run on the cloud. It caters to scenarios
ranging from ad-hoc and exploratory data analysis to development.

In its current form, DataLab enables using services such as Google BigQuery,
and using the combination of SQL, python (and libraries such as pandas and
matplotlib).
