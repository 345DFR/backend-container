      "A _notebook_ is essentially a web document - it can contain descriptive text (authored as markdown, and rendered as HTML as seen here), executable code snippets, and associated results (also rendered as HTML, and fully interactive).\n",
      "\n",
      "Structurally, a notebook is a series of _cells_, or a block of input text to process and evaluate and corresponding results. Cells can be of three types:\n",
      "\n",
      "* Code cells - containing Python code to evaluate\n",
      "* Markdown cells - containing markdown text that is converted to HTML\n",
      "* Header cells - used to organize sections of your notebooks with standard H1...H6 header levels.\n",
      "\n",
      "Each notebook corresponds to a *kernel* or code execution session that resides on the server. The notebook is effectively a front-end to that session. The session consists of state (variables you define, query results, and classes or methods that you have defined in code cells). Each code cell is evaluated in the context of that session, consuming and updating the state of the session along the way.\n",
      "\n",
      "Typically cells are executed in order from top-to-bottom, but the notebook allows you to freely execute cells in any order. You can use cells in both structured fashion, or to evaluate an ad-hoc snippet. Each cell can be modified and re-executed as well.\n",
      "\n",
      "Since execution of cells have side-effects on state in the code execution session, it might be useful to clear all cell output, cleanup any snippets no longer needed, restart the kernel, and then choose to run all cells."
